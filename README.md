# ktube

This is a (stupid) simulator of a [mechanical-switch keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard).

Is simply uses [evdev](http://pythonhosted.org/evdev/) python porting and (a)plays a sound for keydown and keyup event.

The purpose of this code is to drive your workmate crazy.

It has been quickly written for my friend [taubo](https://github.com/taubo).

*May your dreams come true.*

Please note that at the present moment ktube require root privileges to run.
